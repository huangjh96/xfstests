# FS QA Test No. 467
#
# Check open by file handle.
# This is a variant of test generic/426 that tests with less
# files and more use cases:
# - open directory by file handle
# - verify content integrity of file after opening by file handle
# - open by file handle of unlinked open files
# - open by file handle of renamed files
